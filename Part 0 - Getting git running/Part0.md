# Getting git Running

Tasks for this part of the tutorial: 
- [ ] Get git working and do your first commit ("Hello world")
- [ ] Fork this repository 
- [ ] Start your own lab notebook


The first task I will ask you to do is to get git working on your computer. I suggest that all students use GitHub to manage their progress. The goals of using GitHub are first, to build skills in a tool used widely in industry and research; next, save your progress and ensure you don't lose everything if your computer falls in Lake Mendota; and finally, so that I can see what you're doing and provide feedback. 

The first task I will ask you to do is familiarize yourself with git. Here is a great tutorial on its functionality: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world 

To start with, pleaes make a GitHub account and fork this repository (learn more about what that means here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo). You can either use git with the command line, or download the GitHub desktop app (https://desktop.github.com/ ). This will allow you to make alterations to the notebooks without affecting my version of the repository. Throughout the tutorials, there will be places where I ask you to write your own code in the notebooks, and you can do this on your own forked repository. 

Finally, if you are doing reserach, you need to have a lab notebook!  One really important part of research is keeping track of what you try, including what fails and what succeeds. In many wet lab settings (such as biology or chemistry labs), you might do this in a paper lab notebook. For this project, I will ask you to keep a virtual lab notebook in Google Doc form (and, importantly, share the document with me!). Each day you work on the project, make an entry in your document describing what you did and what the results were. Some days, the entry might look like “September 5: trying to install python, but am having trouble. I keep getting the following error message: [copy&paste of the error message]”, while other days you might put a plot you made in the document and describe what you did to make the plot. This document is intended to both be helpful to you (you will be amazed how useful it is to be able to go back and see what you did earlier in the project!), but also allow me to give you real-time feedback and suggestions via comments in the GoogleDoc. 


---If you have a different version control software that you would prefer to use, please let me know! I think git is a great option, but I am open to you using whatever you are comfortable with. ---

---If you are an undergraduate and can't easily install python on your laptop, another option is to use Google Collab: https://colab.research.google.com/ This will let you run Python on the cloud and you won't have to install packages locally, but you will find some downsides (speed, ease of use, and scaling to lager projects). If you plan on doing significant research (more than 1 semester), then I recommend you get Python and Jupyter working on your own personal computer. ---
