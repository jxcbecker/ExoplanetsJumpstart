# Getting Started

This repository contains the resources that will help you get up to speed on the research methods using in exoplanet dynamics research. You will use some real data to learn the most important methods, and by the end of working through everything you should be able to start your own independent research project! 

Some of this you may already know, so feel free to skip around and work on whatever is most useful. Also, you may find that there is not enough detail in some places - if that is the case, please ask questions and I will do my best to help you figure it out!

I will provide a Jupyter notebook as a starting point for each tutorial topic. I suggest that all students use GitHub to manage their progress. The goals of using GitHub are first, to build skills in a tool used widely in industry and research; next, save your progress and ensure you don't lose everything if your computer falls in Lake Mendota; and finally, so that I can see what you're doing and provide feedback. 

You will probably want to have python installed on your computer. I suggest using the Anacnoda distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), but if you already have a different one, that's fine too. You will also need to install several python packages, including the following: rebound, jupyter, matplotlib, numpy, pandas. We can go over how to do that, if you don't know how.
